# Simple_Text_To_Speech
Very simple python code to convert text to speech with tkinter GUI
## Installation 
The text to speech package used is called "pyttsx3", to install it go to your terminal and type "pip install pyttsx3"
### How to use
Once you are done installing the packages, run Main.py 
This will open a simple tkinter GUI where you can type your text and press speak, it will speak the text given.
### Possible errors
This code should work without errors, I tested it myself, however errors can still occur if one or more of these conditions are met

1- No speaker is found : Connect a speaker and restart Main.py

2- Package did not get installed properly : Use pip uninstall pyttsx3 and install it again without doing anything weird.
